Project X – High-Level System Design

Project X is a web-based internal analytics platform used by multiple departments.

Architecture Overview:
- Frontend: React-based SPA
- Backend: Python FastAPI services
- Database: PostgreSQL for transactional data
- Cache Layer: Redis
- Authentication: JWT-based authentication

Key Design Decisions:
1. Microservices architecture was chosen over a monolithic design to allow independent scaling.
2. Services communicate via REST APIs.
3. Redis is used to cache expensive database queries.

Scalability Considerations:
- Stateless backend services allow horizontal scaling.
- Database read replicas were planned for future growth.

Known Limitations:
- Inter-service communication increases operational complexity.
- Requires strong API versioning discipline.

Maintainer Notes:
Ensure backward compatibility when modifying APIs, as multiple teams depend on them.
